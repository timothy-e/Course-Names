# Course Names

A chrome extension that adds hover text to course codes to provide more information. Currently it only works with UW CS course codes.

# To Use
Download the files. Go to `chrome://extensions/` and (with developer mode on), click <kbd>Load Unpacked</kbd> and select this folder. 

Now any page that has a string matching a UW course code* will have it's name pop up when you hover over it.
